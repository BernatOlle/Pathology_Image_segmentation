# Glomerulus Segmentation Pipeline - 1st Place in Both Tracks of the Kidney Pathology Image Segmentation ([KPIs](https://sites.google.com/view/kpis2024/)) Challenge 2024

This repository includes the pipeline and pre-trained models for patch-level and WSI-level glomerulus segmentation.  
All models were trained on the [KPIs](https://sites.google.com/view/kpis2024/) and [mice glomeruli](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.fqz612jpc) datasets

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights
This pipeline won 1st place in both tracks of the Kidney Pathology Image segmentation ([KPIs](https://sites.google.com/view/kpis2024/)) challenge - MICCAI 2024. See the code and solution [here](KPIs2024/Solution.md)

## Installation
We use mmsegmentation package, please follow the [installation guideline](docs/get_started.md) to install the inference code.

## Model Zoo
Please see all pre-trained models in the [model zoo](docs/model_zoo.md)

## Datasets
See [datasets](docs/datasets_howto.md) for download and pre-process the KPIs and mice glomeruli datasets

## Notebooks and inference code will be released soon ...
